YO!
this game was made in a week for fun!
heres how the game works:

you are a gun, dont question it.
you have to shoot these blocks, dont question it.
theres a hidden coin!
and 5 levels.

--HOW THE GAME WORKS--
the bullet is a little offset so you might need to calculate for that a bit.
the farther the crosshair is from the gun the better it'll fly, this is used best for the rebound blocks.
shoot and have fun

--BUGS--
idk, you tell me.
